This program was written in Python.

1. INSTALLING NECESSARY PACKAGES
	pandas, numpy, lxml, and matplotlib must be installed for this program to run.
	These packages can all be installed through anaconda, miniconda, or pip.
	Specific installation instructions can be found at these links:
		pandas - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html
		numpy - https://scipy.org/install.html
		lxml - https://lxml.de/installation.html
		matplotlib - https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

2. RUNNING THE PROGRAM
	This program can be run from the command prompt/terminal. I have attached my program, named phillies_program.py, to this email and you may save it to wherever is most convenient for you.
	In the command prompt/terminal, change to the directory containing the file and then issue the command to run a Python script. On my MacOS device, the command is:
		python phillies_response.py
	Some output will be printed to the command prompt/terminal and graphs will appear in separate windows. You must close out of both graphs before you can run the program again.

Thank you for your consideration!
